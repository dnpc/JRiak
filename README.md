Learning to use Riak with Java

I installed riak instances on Mac and Ubuntu to form a cluster.

I have created some data(goog.csv) following examples from http://docs.basho.com/riak/1.2.0/tutorials/fast-track/

Please change the IP config in RiakClientFactory.java to point at relevant addresses when running the tests.
